Scenario:

You are presented with the source code, tests and documentation for a product. 
The product is at an early state but will soon expand to include more source code, documentation and proper tests.

Assignment:

The product needs a build system that can do the following fully automatic when that source code changes :

•	Compile the source code into a library.
•	Run the tests present in the /tests folder.
•	Package a release containing the library, the include folder and documentation. The tests should also be run and verified in this step.

When it comes to the documentation some extra work is needed. 
The next product release will be of the version specified in /doc/version.txt. Therefore all strings in the documentation 
called "[version]" need to be replaced with the string present in the version file. The title of the documentation file also 
needs to be updated to the correct version. Also there is a copyright text in a separate file that need to be prepended in 
the documentation file.

Use any build system for compiling and linking C code. Ensure that all tasks are automated. You may choose either Linux, Windows or Mac OS as platform.

Good luck!
